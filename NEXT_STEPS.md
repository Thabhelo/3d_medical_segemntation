# Next Steps - 3D Medical Segmentation Project

## âœ… Current Status (September 30, 2025)

**MAJOR MILESTONE ACHIEVED**: All 9 model combinations successfully trained!

- âœ… Complete training matrix: 3 datasets Ã— 3 architectures = 9 models
- âœ… All checkpoints persisted to Google Drive (`results/colab_runs/`)
- âœ… Infrastructure validated and robust
- âœ… Streaming logs with ETA implemented
- âœ… Auto-detection and error handling in place

### Trained Models

| Dataset | UNet | UNETR | SegResNet |
|---------|------|-------|-----------|
| BraTS | âœ… (~17s/epoch) | âœ… | âœ… |
| MSD Liver | âœ… (~1500s/epoch) | âœ… | âœ… |
| TotalSegmentator | âœ… (~2000s/epoch) | âœ… | âœ… |

## ðŸŽ¯ Immediate Next Steps

### 1. **Model Evaluation** (Ready to Run)

**What**: Evaluate all 9 trained models to get performance metrics

**How**: Run the evaluation cell in `notebooks/00_environment_setup.ipynb`
```python
# Cell 6 - Evaluation
import sys, subprocess
print('Launching scripts/evaluate_models.py...')
result = subprocess.run([sys.executable, '-u', 'scripts/evaluate_models.py'], 
                       capture_output=False, text=True)
print(f'\nEvaluation completed with exit code: {result.returncode}')
```

**Expected Output**:
- Validation Dice scores for all 9 models
- Model complexity comparison (parameters, size)
- Best performing model per dataset
- Results saved to `results/colab_runs/evaluation_results.json`

**Note**: Current models trained for only 2 epochs (infrastructure validation). Dice scores will be low (~0.0-0.2).

### 2. **Extended Training Runs** (For Production Metrics)

**What**: Re-run experiments with 50-100 epochs for meaningful performance

**Why**: 2-epoch runs were smoke tests; production training needs convergence

**How**: Update `scripts/run_experiments.py`:
```python
# Change this line:
MAX_EPOCHS = 2  # Current
# To:
MAX_EPOCHS = 100  # Production
```

**Then run** the training cell again (skip logic will prevent re-running completed models unless you delete checkpoints)

**Estimated Time**: 
- BraTS: ~30 min per model (17s Ã— 100 epochs)
- MSD Liver: ~42 hours per model (1500s Ã— 100 epochs)
- TotalSegmentator: ~56 hours per model (2000s Ã— 100 epochs)

**Tip**: Run overnight on Colab Pro with background execution

### 3. **Results Analysis** (After Evaluation)

**What**: Statistical analysis and architectural comparison

**Tasks**:
- [ ] Generate learning curves from training logs
- [ ] Perform ANOVA to test statistical significance
- [ ] Compare architecture performance across datasets
- [ ] Analyze model complexity vs accuracy trade-offs
- [ ] Create visualization notebooks for sample predictions

**Create**: `notebooks/01_results_analysis.ipynb`

---

### 4. **Visualization & Reporting**

**What**: Visual analysis and comprehensive report

**Tasks**:
- [ ] Sample prediction visualizations (ground truth vs predictions)
- [ ] Confusion matrices for multi-class segmentation
- [ ] Architecture comparison charts (bar plots, heatmaps)
- [ ] Learning curve plots (loss and Dice over epochs)
- [ ] Qualitative failure case analysis

**Create**: `notebooks/02_visualizations.ipynb`

---

### 5. **Documentation Finalization**

**What**: Complete technical report and reproducibility guide

**Tasks**:
- [ ] Populate results tables in `DOCUMENTATION.md`
- [ ] Add statistical analysis section
- [ ] Include architectural insights and clinical recommendations
- [ ] Create reproducibility checklist
- [ ] Update README with final results and usage instructions
